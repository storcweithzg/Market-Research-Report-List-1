<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Flat Panel X-Ray Detectors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Indirect Conversion FPDs</li><li>Direct Conversion FPDs</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Flat Panel X-Ray Detectors (FPDs) are crucial in medical imaging, categorized mainly into indirect and direct conversion types. Indirect conversion FPDs use a scintillator to convert X-rays into visible light, which is then detected by a photodetector, offering high image quality and sensitivity. Direct conversion FPDs, on the other hand, directly convert X-ray photons into electrical signals, providing faster imaging and reduced noise levels. Both types enhance diagnostic capability, with applications in radiography, fluoroscopy, and mammography.</p></p>
