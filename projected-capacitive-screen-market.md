<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Projected Capacitive Screen Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Self Capacitance</li><li>Mutual Capacitance</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The projected capacitive screen market is primarily divided into two types: self-capacitance and mutual capacitance. Self-capacitance relies on individual capacitive sensors for each touch point, allowing for precise input detection but limiting touch sensitivity to fewer simultaneous touches. In contrast, mutual capacitance employs a grid of electrodes, enabling multiple simultaneous touches and gestures. This architecture enhances responsiveness and allows for more complex interactions, making mutual capacitance the preferred choice for modern touchscreens, especially in smartphones and tablets.</p></p>
