<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Magnetic Float Level Sensors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Continuous Type</li><li>Liquid Level Switch Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Magnetic float level sensors are key in liquid level measurement, available in two main types. Continuous type sensors provide real-time, continuous monitoring of liquid levels, allowing for precise data on level changes. They typically use a float that moves along a guide, generating a corresponding output signal. Liquid level switch type sensors, on the other hand, detect specific liquid levels to trigger alarms or control mechanisms, offering discrete, point-based measurements ideal for applications requiring on/off control.</p></p>
