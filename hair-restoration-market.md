<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Hair Restoration Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Follicular Unit Extraction</li><li>Follicular Unit Transplantation</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The hair restoration market primarily includes two techniques: Follicular Unit Extraction (FUE) and Follicular Unit Transplantation (FUT). FUE involves extracting individual hair follicles from a donor area and transplanting them to thinning or balding spots, offering minimal scarring and quicker recovery. In contrast, FUT involves removing a strip of scalp containing hair follicles, which are then dissected and transplanted. FUT may result in linear scars but can yield a higher number of grafts in a single session. Both methods cater to different patient needs and preferences.</p></p>
